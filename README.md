the oo.org Project Management Office minisite

Scope: 

An app that lets teams list their projects in a way that: 

- promotes discovery (search, filter by attribute, featured, popular, curated topic, freshness, lifecycle stage)
- lets teams edit project profiles
- lets teams post status updates (project notices, announcements/news/blog posts, github checkins)
- lets teams post shopping lists (help wanted, things to work on, problems to solve, tools that would help)
- helps volunteers find ways to help
- shows team members and contributors 
- collects metrics from apps 
- supports analysis of app portfolio
- helps people discuss and share a project or group of projects or updates
- emits a stream of updates to an email account, RSS feed, and twitter
- users can subscribe to updates on a fraction of the activity 
- loads quickly with minimal bandwidth costs for mobile users
- is automatically backed up and restorable
- scales to thousands of projects
- can be easily forked and redeployed to other organizations
- versions content so edit history is available and can be undone

So that:

- volunteers are more engaged
- product, project, and department leaders can better guide their projects
- teams have better peripheral vision into other projects
- the projects team can manage the portfolio
- product "about" pages can remain fresh
